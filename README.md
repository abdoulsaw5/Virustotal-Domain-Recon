# Virustotal-Domain-Recon
VirusTotal is a tool that many use for analyzing files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses to determine whether they are malicious, while it is used for safety. Virustotal can be used for Recon to find sub domains. I have developed a tool that uses the Virustotal API to fetch subdomains. For this to work you must alreadyd have a Virustotal account and an API key.
